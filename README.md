# Kandl
Kandl is an ecommerce website that allows users to purchase hand made natural candles and soaps, developed for Milestone 4 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software Development (Full stack) course.

- There are two types of users, and I have set up accounts for both
    - An admin(administrator) user account has been set up with username/password of rocoboco55/Primafirma100da
    - A regular(shopper) user account has been set up with username/password of testtest1/test2022
    - When making a payment as a regular user, a test credit card of 4242424242424242 has been set up for the card number
    - For the expiry date, cvc and postal code any series number(s) can be used(once they meet the mimimum values)
